        <p>My name is Denise Roberts. What started off as a love/hate relationship with writing
			transformed into a passion about a year ago. It wasn't just the art of writing that grabbed me. It
			was the endless subjects and undiscovered topics that was a thrill. I like to write about taboo or
			bizarre subjects. Just as I would rather read an article about the benefits of lucid dreaming over
			the benefits of healthy eating, I would much prefer to write about the former as well. I always
			search for the story written underground or hiding behind years of disbelief. The surface stories
			will indeed receive coverage, but what about the one about the story that doesn't know it is a
			story?</p>
			
			<p>Outside of news writing, I have a passion for nonprofits. I will write press releases, web content,
			anything they may need to help their organization. Once I wrote a human interest piece for a
			rehabilitation organization in the perspective of the parents of the addicts. I have realized small
			self-striving companies need a helping handing sometimes so the community can know of their
			missions and goals.</p>
			
			<p>My philosophy is everyone and everything has a story. My job, as an aspiring writer, is to find it.</p>
